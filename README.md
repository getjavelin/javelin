# üõ°Ô∏è Javelin: AI Security Platform for Modern Enterprises

Javelin is an enterprise-grade AI Security Platform built to defend LLM applications against adversarial inputs, data leakage, prompt injection, and unsafe model behavior. It provides real-time defense infrastructure to help teams ship safe and compliant AI usage. 

‚∏ª

## üîç What Javelin Does

Javelin equips security and ML teams with tools to:
	‚Ä¢	Monitor and enforce AI usage policies at runtime via secure proxying and threat detection.
	‚Ä¢	Continuously test AI endpoints using adversarial prompts and curated test datasets.
	‚Ä¢	Evaluate model outputs for harmful content, overreliance, hallucination, and compliance risks.
	‚Ä¢	Align with AI risk standards like OWASP LLM Top 10 and NIST AI RMF.
	‚Ä¢	Report and respond to prompt injection, misuse, or misbehavior in production systems.

‚∏ª

## üß± Core Components
‚úÖ 1. AI Usage Monitoring (Runtime Defense)
	‚Ä¢	Proxy LLM traffic with policy enforcement (rate limits, auth, logging).
	‚Ä¢	Catch security violations in real-time with contextual alerts.
 
‚úÖ 2. Output Evaluation
	‚Ä¢	Automatically judge model responses against expected behavior.
	‚Ä¢	Plug in evaluation criteria such as safety, factuality, bias, compliance, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Store pass/fail results for audit and triage.

‚úÖ 3. Red Teaming & Prompt Testing
	‚Ä¢	Launch structured and custom scans against LLM endpoints.
	‚Ä¢	Use curated libraries of attack prompts or auto-generate mutations via LLM agents.
	‚Ä¢	Test against taxonomies of risks (e.g., prompt injection ‚Üí system prompt leak ‚Üí disclose_system_vars).
