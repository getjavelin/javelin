# 🛡️ Javelin: AI Security Platform for Modern Enterprises

Javelin is an enterprise-grade AI Security Platform built to defend LLM Agents against adversarial inputs, data leakage, prompt injection, and unsafe model behavior. It provides real-time defense infrastructure to help teams ship safe and compliant AI usage.

## 🔍 What Javelin Does

**Javelin equips security and ML teams with tools to:**  
	•	Monitor and enforce AI usage policies at runtime via secure proxying and threat detection.  
	•	Continuously test AI agents using adversarial prompts and curated test datasets.  
	•	Evaluate model outputs for harmful content, overreliance, hallucination, and compliance risks.  
	•	Align with AI risk standards like OWASP LLM Top 10 and NIST AI RMF.  
	•	Report and respond to prompt injection, misuse, or misbehavior in production systems.

## 🧱 Core Components
✅ **1. AI Usage Monitoring (Runtime Defense)**
	•	Proxy LLM agentic traffic with policy enforcement (rate limits, auth, logging).
	•	Catch security violations in real-time with contextual alerts.
 
✅ **2. Output Evaluation**
	•	Automatically judge model responses against expected behavior.
	•	Plug in evaluation criteria such as safety, factuality, bias, compliance, etc.
	•	Store pass/fail results for audit and triage.

✅ **3. Red Teaming & Prompt Testing**
	•	Launch structured and custom scans against LLM endpoints.
	•	Use curated libraries of attack prompts or auto-generate mutations via LLM agents.
	•	Test against taxonomies of risks (e.g., prompt injection → system prompt leak → disclose_system_vars).
